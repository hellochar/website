/**
* <p>For any single point on the sphere, we call the "local plane" of that point to be the plane tangent to the sphere at that point.
* We call this point the "center" of the local plane. We can represent any point p on the sphere onto a local plane by taking p's
* projection onto the local plane and then scaling it to have magnitude equal to the great circle distance between p and the local plane's center.
* We can then do operations on on such points as if they were in simple 2D cartesian coordinates. To convert a point from its local plane representation
* back into the spherical surface, we express the 2d point in its equivalent 3d coordinates (e.g. using to3D), calling it P, and cross the (normalized center
* of the local plane in 3D coordinates) with P. The resulting 3D vector V is a rotation vector, normal to both the center and the direction in which you want to
* move from the center, and of magnitude equal to the quantity to move from the center. We can get the corresponding point by calling move(center, V). </p>
*
* <p>Specifically, this allows us to handle vectors calculated in local plane coordinates since the butt of the vector is situated at the local plane's origin, which
* coincides with its center, and the head of the vector is situated at a point, which we can then convert to 3D.</p>
*
* <p>How to handle antipodal point? The antipodal point will also be at the origin. So the LocalPlane isn't perfectly 1-1.</p>
*
* <p>The LocalPlane is actually an azimuthal projection.

* In this sketch I want to be able to get a framework or show a proof of concept of adding velocities and forces in spherical coordinates. Consider
* if you have the points p = (1, 0, 0), r1 = (0, 1, 0) and r2 = (0, 0, 1). p wants to get "repelled" by both of these points. For each point r1 or r2,
* I can imagine a transform that represents the repelling force that that point exerts on p. Translations on the sphere are represented as rotations
* around some principle axis. So, we can represent this repelling force by a rotation transform; this in turn can be represented using either an axis angle
* or a quaternion.
